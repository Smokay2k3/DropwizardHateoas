A Dropwizard based general playground
====================
* for dropwizard (all aspects)
* for HATEOS
* for Google Guice
* Java 8
* and any other frameworks.

As this is a playground some of the boundaries are purposely stretched for
experimentation purposes. In other worlds **Don't try this in production kids**.

To run: `gradle run` or run the PersonApplication

The application starts on http://localhost:9090
the admin app starts on http://localhost::9091

The application comes with a couple of test records, so you can start off with a GET:

GET: [http://localhost:9090/perons]

As standard dropwizard at startup shows all the services available
